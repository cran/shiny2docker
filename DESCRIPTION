Description: 
    Automates the creation of Dockerfiles for deploying 'Shiny' applications.
    By integrating with 'renv' for dependency management and leveraging Docker-based
    solutions, it simplifies the process of containerizing 'Shiny' apps,
    ensuring reproducibility and consistency across different environments.
    Additionally, it facilitates the setup of CI/CD pipelines for building Docker images
    on both GitLab and GitHub.
